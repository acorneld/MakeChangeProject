### Make Change Project

#### Description
This is a program that shows the user how much change the customer is owed from a purchase.
The change will be displayed in both the total change as well as a breakdown of which denominations to give them!  If the customer gives too little monies an ERROR! message will be displayed.
#### Lessons Learned

I had proper logic when I got to the point where I was doing the conversion for quarters to dimes but it would not work.  Adding a small number to account for the rounding error from casting in Int resolved this issue.

#### Technologies Used
Eclipse IDE
Github


#### What was fun
Figuring out the overall structure and then realizing that I could "waterfall"
it in a way once the initial logic was solved.
